# ATLAS-OS

ATLAS-OS is the "OS layer" for the ATLAS project: installer scripts, system configuration, and Pi/edge-node setup files.

This repository is **automatically kept in sync** from a private ATLAS repo. You generally should not hand-edit files here unless you know what you're doing (see "Contributing").

---

## What this repo contains

Typical contents (depends on your setup):
- install scripts for Raspberry Pi / Debian-based systems
- systemd service files
- config templates
- bootstrap tooling (one-command setup)
- docs for provisioning and updates

> If you're looking for the full ATLAS source code, that lives in a separate private repo.
